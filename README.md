## Smart Pointer Exercise ##

The file `smart_int_ptr.hpp` contains a skeleton of a simple "smart pointer" 
which manages the lifetime of a dynamically allocated `int`.

Your task is implement the various member functions given the requirements in
the comments.

If you finish early, then as an extension see if you can implement the rest of the `unique_ptr` API
(including move semantics!) for the `int_ptr` class.
